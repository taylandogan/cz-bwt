# cz-bwt

Implementation of the paper "Fast Algorithm of Truncated Burrows-Wheeler Transform Coding for Data Compression of Sensors" by Jiancheng et al.

You may read the paper here: https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/6908760

Just run the Makefile and try different inputs. CZ-BWT has different results compared to regular Burrows-Wheeler Transform algorithm.

Also, I left some comments for possible optimizations if you are interested. ( Just look for: // TODO:)
